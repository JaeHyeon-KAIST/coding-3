## pm25 headline (rc22 Tier 3 FIRST pass)

**rc22 Policy Distillation** — numpy MLP (20→32→1, ~2K params) distilled from rc82 teacher.
- **Data**: 100 games rc82 vs baseline → 59,828 (φ(s,a), teacher_action) records. Teacher collected at 96% WR.
- **Training**: 50 epochs, SGD+momentum lr=1e-3, val_acc 90.3% (info-bottleneck ceiling).
- **HTH**: 88/100 = **88%** vs baseline Wilson [0.802, 0.930], 0 crashes. Beats A1 (82.5%).
- **Files**: `experiments/distill_rc22.py`, `minicontest/zoo_distill_collector.py` (teacher+logger), `minicontest/zoo_distill_rc22.py` (student, numpy-only inference).
- **Strategic value**: First architecturally different Phase 4 pool member (neural vs hand-rule) → adds diversity. Demonstrates Tier 3 feasibility.

| **rc34** Pavlovian feinting | 0/20 | 0/20 | 0/40 | **0%** | ❌ DROP |

**pm24 cumulative rc count**: 31 new rc (pm23 = 16 pass + 1 drop rc18; pm24 = 14 pass + 2 drop rc30/34).
**Pool size for Phase 4**: 31 rc + A1/O2/O3/(O4) + D1/D2/D3/D13/T4/T5 = ~38 candidates.
**3 champions at 100% WR**: rc02 (Tarjan AP), rc16 (Voronoi), rc82 (rc29+rc44 combo).

**Insights (pm24)**:
1. **Stochastic top-K injection catastrophic** — rc29 (threat-conditioned REVERSE) passes, rc34 (time-conditioned blind) fails.
2. **Orthogonal overlays compose** — rc82 (rc29+rc44) ties the 100% ceiling. Tactical + strategic layers stack.
3. **Role-asymmetric design viable** — rc84 (rc82+rc02) 95%+, rc90 (rc82+rc32) **97.5%** best asym so far. Pincer defender > AP defender for this composition.
4. **Layout conditioning helps** — rc21 95% with ×1.10/×0.90 class multiplier alone.
5. **Ensemble dilution** — rc83 (5-way vote) 90% < rc82 solo 100%. Voting over weaker members pulls top signal down.
6. **Stacked overlays preserve quality** — rc86 (rc82+rc48) 95%+. Sequential override (apply strongest, then filter) doesn't dilute.
7. **Narrow fire-conditions essential** — rc87 (far-food always-on when safe) 55% and rc89 (dead-end avoid 5-cell) 55%. Overlays that fire too often destroy A1's tuned behavior. Successful overlays (rc02 invader-visible, rc29 herded, rc48 collision) all have tight triggers.
8. **2-ply lookahead modest gain** — rc88 80%, better than A1 82.5%? Actually below. Self-play lookahead without opponent model doesn't always help reflex policies.

## Headline

40-game reverification with same `-b baseline -n 10` protocol for all candidates. **Prior 10-game judgements were undersampled and partly wrong**. Canonical table (vs `baseline.py`, defaultCapture, 40 games):

| Agent | W | L | T | Win% | Loss% | Tie% | Net |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `zoo_reflex_tuned` (control) | 0 | 0 | 40 | 0% | 0% | **100%** | 0 |
| `zoo_reflex_h1test` (both-OFFENSE) | 14 | 14 | 12 | **35%** | 35% | 30% | 0 |
| `zoo_reflex_h1b` (role-split, ~~REJECTED~~ RESURRECTED) | 12 | 4 | 24 | 30% | **10%** | 60% | **+8** |
| `zoo_reflex_h1c` (capsule-exploit, new run) | 8 | 2 | 30 | 20% | 5% | 75% | +6 |
| `zoo_reflex_h1c` (pm3 earlier run) | 4 | 4 | 32 | 10% | 10% | 80% | 0 |

Key reversals: (1) **H1b was wrongly rejected** — 40-game sample gives 30% win with 10% loss (lower risk than H1). (2) **H1 still leads on raw win% = grading metric** at 35%, but **cannot clear 51%** (14/40 vs p=0.51: z=-2.07, p≈0.02 → single-dict tuning definitively insufficient for code 40pt). (3) **H1c variance large between runs** (10%→20% across two identical 40-game invocations); 40 games still under-powered for <5%-point CIs. (4) **ReflexTuned 100% tie** confirms original deadlock is structural and reproducible. (5) **`your_baseline1/2/3.py` are DummyAgent (random) copies** — capture.py 4-loop is actually a "vs [random×3, baseline×1]" grading protocol for `output.csv`; before M8 submission we must populate them with our own variants. Next: pivot to **M4 infra patches + M6 evolution** as the only path to 51%.

**Tier policy (applies to any 1h+ milestone): each sub-tier is an independent resumable unit with a Go/No-go gate at the end. User decides after each gate whether to continue, pause, or pivot. No milestone commits us to more than ~4h of uninterrupted work.**

## Compute dispatch policy (pm17 — remote server provisioned)

| task class | venue | command pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Quick smoke (pop≤4, 1 gen, ≤10 min) | **Mac** | `.venv/bin/python experiments/evolve.py …` |
| Mid tuning (pop 8-16, 2-5 gen) | Either | Mac if convenient |
| **Heavy evolve (pop≥16, ≥5 gen, ≥30 min)** | **Server (jdl_wsl tmux work)** | `ssh jdl_wsl "tmux send-keys -t work '… 2>&1 \| tee logs/<name>.log' Enter"` |
| Large tournament (≥100 matches) | Server | same pattern |
| Result analysis / report writing | **Mac** | inline Claude context |

Server: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X (16 phys / 32 threads), 128 GB RAM, WSL2 Ubuntu, `~/projects/coding-3`. Measured 2.25× faster than Mac M3 Pro on `evolve` `pop=16 workers=16`. Full env doc: wiki `environment/remote-compute-infra-wsl2-ryzen-7950x-server-jdl-wsl`. Dispatch directive in project memory (high priority).

⚠️ **Cross-platform fitness reproducibility imperfect** — same `--master-seed` on Mac vs server can yield different best/mean. Use server for fitness ranking; verify the *final* `your_best.py` win-rate on Mac before submission.

M6 budget on server (Option A bypass + 2.25× server):
- Phase 2a 10 gens × 40 pop × 264 games / 16 workers ≈ **~5 h**
- Phase 2b 20 gens × 40 pop × 224 games / 16 workers ≈ **~5-6 h**
- **M6 total ≈ 10-11 h** — overnight on the server.

## Critical observations / blockers

🟢 **CAPTURE.PY 4-LOOP PROTOCOL — DECODED 2026-04-15 pm4** — `capture.py:1054-1074` loops over `lst=['your_baseline1','your_baseline2','your_baseline3','baseline.py']` to build `output.csv` for the assignment's required comparison report. `your_baseline1/2/3.py` are currently **identical copies of myTeam.py = DummyAgent (random actions)**. So `-n 10 -b baseline` = 40 games all vs baseline.py; bare `-n 10` = 10 vs random ×3 blocks + 10 vs baseline. Before M8 submission, we must populate `your_baseline1/2/3.py` with our own variants (per CLAUDE.md spec) so `output.csv` shows a meaningful 4-way comparison for the report.

🟡 **DEADLOCK — STRUCTURAL, CONFIRMED 2026-04-15 pm4** — `zoo_reflex_tuned.py` (untouched seed weights) produces **0W/0L/40T** vs baseline across a 40-game reverification. The original deadlock claim (0/47 in M1-M3) is exactly reproducible. Weight patches in H1/H1b/H1c break the deadlock (tie% drops from 100% to 30-75%), but none clear 51% win rate.

🔴 **SINGLE-DICT TUNING STATISTICALLY INSUFFICIENT (2026-04-15 pm4)** — H1 14/40 at p=0.51 gives z=-2.07 (p≈0.02). We can reject 51% with 95% confidence for H1 on baseline. H1b (12/40) and H1c (4-8/40) are further below. No pure weight-scaling of `SEED_WEIGHTS_OFFENSIVE` / `SEED_WEIGHTS_DEFENSIVE` will clear grading threshold. Policy-level change required: coordination protocol, role swap, search-based planning, OR **M6 CEM evolution over wider search space**. `evolve.py:140-142` NotImplementedError fix is now ON the critical path.

🟡 **H1b RESURRECTION — pm2 rejection overturned** — The pm2 session concluded H1b "rejected" based on a single 10-game block (1W/2L/7T). 40-game reverification shows 12W/4L/24T (30% W, 10% L, **+8 net** — highest among all diagnostics). H1b has the lowest risk profile (4 losses vs H1's 14). For tournament (diverse opponents), a low-loss / moderate-win variant might rank better than H1's high-variance profile. Keep H1b as a live seed variant for M6.

🔴 **Evolution silent-failure risk (`evolve.py:140-142`)** — `evaluate_genome` raises `NotImplementedError`; the enclosing try/except swallows it into `f=0.0`. A 20h M6 campaign would "complete successfully" and emit `final_weights.py` of random noise. MUST fix before any M5 dry-run. See wiki `debugging/experiments-infrastructure-audit-...`.

🟢 **Seed workaround applied & validated (pm7 autopilot)** — `run_match.py` no longer passes `--fixRandomSeed` (which hardcoded `random.seed('cs188')` in capture.py, dropping the seed VALUE and causing pm6's 95.2% tie lock); seed is now routed through the `-l RANDOM<seed>` layout-generator form. Variance smoke 5 reps produced 3 distinct outcomes. M4-v2 tie rate dropped 95.2% → 90.6% with real cross-layout signal. Code-reviewer APPROVED (0 🔴). Trade-off: named-layout reproducibility lost, but usable ELO restored.

🟢 **M6-a.1 smoke confirms CEM learns (pm16)** — 4 gens × 20 pop × 12 games × 3 dry opps on defaultCapture, `--init-mean-from h1test` + `population[0]=mean` elitism. best_fitness ascended **0.160 → 0.273 → 0.323 → 0.774** (4.8× over gen 0, ~82% win rate against the dry pool at fitness 0.774). snr stable at 1.1+ (STRATEGY §6.3 drift alert threshold cleared every generation). mean_fitness rose 0.009 → 0.171 (population centroid approaching elite region). σ decayed 14.7 → 6.9 on key features (STRATEGY 0.9×/gen schedule holding). Mean_genome shows CEM exploring AWAY from h1test seed — e.g. f_successorScore 100→113, f_bias 0→-6.9, f_distToFood 10→-0.9 — suggesting a *different* local optimum than the seed. Real-scale (M6-a.2 full) run to verify on the 11-opp pool.

🟢 **A1 17-dim full-scale evolution learning confirmed (pm18)** — Order 1 launched on server at 06:37; first 3 gens: best **0.112 → 0.181 → 0.483** (4.3× over gen 0), mean **0.007 → 0.026 → 0.099**, snr **0.61 → 0.91 → 1.10** (gen 2 crossed STRATEGY §6.3 threshold, stagnation_count reset to 0). gen 0 best=0.112 ≈ h1test seed fitness on the harder 11-opp pool (pool_wr ~0.2 minus stddev penalty). gen 2 best=0.483 suggests CEM discovered a ~48% pool-win-rate genome — meaningful learning. Wall **stable at 46.6-48.8 min/gen** (no ProcessPool ramp-up; this IS the per-gen cost). Re-estimation: Phase 2a ≈ 7.8h, Phase 2b ≈ 11h, **total ≈ 18-19h**, finish ETA ~00:40 next day — overnight viable but ~2× wiki's 10h estimate. Pool: `baseline×2 + zoo_reflex_{h1test,h1b,h1c,aggressive,defensive} + zoo_minimax_{ab_d2,ab_d3_opp} + zoo_expectimax + monster_rule_expert` (11 slots, MCTS excluded due to 120s run_match timeout — fixed for Order 2+ once ZOO_MCTS_MOVE_BUDGET override is added).

🟡 **Order 6 blocker — MCTS evolve container needs budget override (pm18)** — C4 set MOVE_BUDGET=0.80s for submission safety, but full 1200-move MCTS game wall ≈ 5 min >> run_match.py's 120s per-game timeout. Every MCTS-container training match would forfeit. Fix: add `ZOO_MCTS_MOVE_BUDGET` env var read at each `_mcts_search` / `_search` call (fallback to `MOVE_BUDGET`). Evolve training can then set `ZOO_MCTS_MOVE_BUDGET=0.1` via `run_match.py env=`, keeping submission behaviour unchanged. ~15 lines patch across 3 files. **Not a blocker for Order 1 (A1 currently running) or Orders 2-5 (reflex/minimax containers) — only Order 6 (C4+B1 MCTS container) is blocked.**

🟢 **M6 budget restored via 4-loop bypass (pm14 Option A)** — `experiments/single_game.py` imports `capture.readCommand` + `capture.runGames` directly and calls them from its own `__main__`; `capture.py`'s `__main__` block (which held the 4-loop) never executes. `capture.py` itself is untouched (CLAUDE.md compliant). Measured impact: **per-match wall 7.74s → 1.70s (4.55× speedup)**, overall T1-T3 wall 140s → 44s (~3.2× at test scale). T1 run A/B produced identical pool_win=0.25 confirming correctness. Re-extrapolated M6: Phase 2a **~8.5-12h**, Phase 2b **~14-20h**, **total ≈ 23-32h** — STRATEGY §6.6's 20h target in reach without scale-down. (D) hybrid is no longer needed; (B) scale-down kept as fallback only. M6-a smoke (Phase 2a, 2 gens × 40 pop, ~45-60min expected) is now cleanly launchable per tier policy.

🟢 **M4-v2 canonical ELO (pm7) — 15 agents × defaultCapture+RANDOM × 2 seeds × 1 rep = 840 games / 0 crashes / 32m28s wall**. Top-3 by ELO (all rankings relative, baseline as reference anchor):
| Agent | ELO | vs baseline (8g) | Win% | Net |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | 1610.7 | — | — | — |
| **zoo_reflex_h1test** | **1584.6** | 4W/3L/1T | **50%** | +1 |
| zoo_reflex_h1c | 1532.5 | 1W/5L/2T | 12.5% | -4 |
| **zoo_reflex_h1b** | 1503.8 | 3W/1L/4T | 37.5% | +2 |
| (other reflex/minimax/expectimax/monster_rule) | ~1470-1490 | all 0W/0L/8T | 0% | 0 |
| zoo_approxq_{v1,v2_deeper}, zoo_dummy | ~1468-1479 | 0W/{7,8}L | 0% | -7 to -8 |

**3-way corroboration across pm4 (40g on defaultCapture) / M4-v1 (2g deterministic) / M4-v2 (8g varied)**:
- **h1test is the single-dict winner**: pm4 35% → v2 50% (RANDOM layouts amplify 2-OFFENSE formation's attack advantage). Preferred M6 evolution seed.
- **h1b is the robust runner-up**: pm4 30% → v2 37.5%. Consistent profile.
- **h1c is map-sensitive**: pm4 20% on defaultCapture, v2 12.5% when RANDOM layouts rotate capsule position — capsule-exploit fails outside favourable layouts.
- **All minimax/expectimax/monster_rule agents** are 0W/0L/8T vs baseline — tie-deadlock persists across layouts, confirming the structural issue is not layout-specific.
- **approxQ_{v1,v2_deeper} + zoo_dummy** are decisively the weakest (q-learning is UNLEARNED; require M6 evolution to become meaningful).

Artifact: `experiments/artifacts/tournament_results/m4_full_pm7_v2.csv`.

**Statistical caveat**: n=8 vs baseline per agent still wide CI. For 51% grading threshold at 95%: need ~100 games per agent. Either M4-v3 scale-up (same pipeline, more seeds/layouts, ~4h) OR M6 evolution which naturally runs thousands.

🟡 **MCTS/deep-minimax time budget issue (pm6)** — `zoo_mcts_heuristic` (MAX_ITERS=1000, no time polling) timed out 10/10 matches in M4 smoke. Excluded in M4-v1 along with `zoo_mcts_random`, `zoo_mcts_q_guided`, `monster_mcts_hand`, `monster_minimax_d4`. These 5 need MAX_ITERS/ROLLOUT_DEPTH reduction or real-time budget polling — deferred to M7.5 time calibration.

🟢 **Tournament CSV durability — CSV-append + fsync + resume DONE (pm5, autopilot run)** — `tournament.py` now writes each row with `flush()+fsync()` + parent-dir fsync on first-write (hard-crash survival on APFS). Added `_load_completed_keys()` helper + `--resume-from` CLI flag; (red,blue,layout,seed) dedup on resume. Code-reviewer APPROVED (0 🔴, 2 🟡 orthogonal, 3 🟢 nits). 4-test QA: fresh run (2 jobs, 7s, 0 crash), rerun (skip 2, nothing to do), partial skip (seed 1 2 → skip 2 + append 2, single header), regression after dir-fsync add (pass). See wiki session-log `2026-04-15-pm5-tournament-csv-append-resume-patch`. Residual (separate patch): sliding futures window for 85MB memory footprint at M6 scale.

🟡 **Tournament sliding futures window (deferred)** — `tournament.py:128` still eagerly submits all futures upfront; at M6 ~280K jobs this builds ~85MB of Future objects in parent. Not a correctness issue, but a parent-process memory concern. Patch: replace `{pool.submit(...): job for job in jobs}` one-shot dict with a sliding in-flight window of `workers × 4`. ~20 lines.

🟡 **BrokenProcessPool unhandled (deferred)** — single worker segfault still aborts the whole tournament. CSV-append lifeline means restart with `--resume-from` recovers progress, but a recovery loop around `ProcessPoolExecutor` would avoid manual babysitting. Audit wiki M3.

🟡 **Subprocess process-group leakage** — `run_match.py:80` lacks `start_new_session=True`; on TimeoutExpired, grandchildren can orphan. 1-line fix + `os.killpg` on timeout.

🟡 **Submission flatten not yet implemented** — `experiments/select_top4.py` is a skeleton; the `flatten_agent` function raises `NotImplementedError`. Required by M7. Plan has the recipe, but the AST-based concatenation logic needs implementation. Also: `FAMILY_MAP` missing entries for `zoo_dummy`, `zoo_reflex_h1test` (and future h1b/h1c) — silent drop risk during selection.

🟢 **Pre-α complete (2026-04-15 pm9)** — 5-stage preflight before Option α. **Stage 1 baseline**: 1 genome × 72 games sequential = 557s (7.74s/match); sequential extrapolation of M6 full = **186h (~8 days, non-viable)**; 8-way parallel target = 23.2h (≈ STRATEGY §6.6's 20h spec). **Stage 2 STRATEGY §6 gap analysis**: confirmed match (G11 CRN pairing, G3 stddev k=0.5, G8 Phase2→3 transition); scope-in for α (G4 CLI args, G12 ProcessPool, G10 truncated eval optional); scope-out (G1 20-dim claim → doc fix, G5 HALL_OF_FAME, G6 sequential-halving, G7 restart-random, G9 2-elitism — nice-to-have). **Stage 3** T1-T4 test plan (same-genome repeatability, parallel independence, crash isolation, resume integrity) → wiki `pattern/option-test-plan-t1-t4-...`. **Stage 4 ADR**: genome-level ProcessPoolExecutor (workers = min(cores-1, 8)); resume reads existing `{phase}_gen{N}.json` + `best_ever_*` forward-compat fields → wiki `decision/adr-evolve-py-parallelization-...`. **Critical path now**: implement α.

🟡 **Time calibration deferred to M7.5** — `MOVE_BUDGET = 0.80s` is a placeholder. Algorithmic bounds (`MAX_ITERS=1000`, `MAX_DEPTH=3`, `ROLLOUT_DEPTH=20`) are the actual time controllers during dev. Final values come from M7.5 measurement on dev hardware + `taskset/cpulimit` TA simulation.

## Next-session quick start

**STOP and read `.omc/SESSION_RESUME.md` first.** That's the 5-minute onboarding. This STATUS.md is the deeper detail.

If you skipped SESSION_RESUME: the immediate next action is the **M4 infra patch set** — fix `evolve.py:140-142` `NotImplementedError` swallow (ON critical path now that single-dict tuning is statistically rejected), `run_match.py:72` seed plumbing, `tournament.py` CSV-append + sliding futures window. Then M4 tournament pipeline activation. Do NOT run another single-dict H1d variant — pm4 reverification proved single-dict tuning tops out at H1's 35% (statistically below 51% threshold).
